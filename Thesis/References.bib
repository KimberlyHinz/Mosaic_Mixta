There is an increasing interest in the use of these genome sequences to assess evolutionary relationships among microbial taxa, as it is anticipated that much additional taxonomic information can be extracted from these sequences. In a first part of the present review, mechanisms that are responsible for the evolution of genomes will be discussed. Subsequently, we will give an overview of approaches that are presently available to assess the taxonomic relationships between prokaryotic species based on complete genome sequences, followed by a brief discussion of the potential implications of these novel approaches for bacterial taxonomy in general and our thinking about the bacterial species concept in particular.},

abstract = {Species belonging to the genus of Pantoea are commonly isolated from plants, humans and the natural environment. The species of the genus are phenotypically closely related, making rapid identification of Pantoea strains to the species level difficult. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) was evaluated as a means for rapid classification and identification of Pantoea strains. Four housekeeping genes, gyrB, rpoB, atpD and infB, were sequenced for strains assigned to the genus. Included in the study were (1) reference strains from the seven currently recognized species of Pantoea, (2) strains belonging to Brenner DNA groups II, IV and V, previously isolated from clinical samples and difficult to identify because of high phenotypic similarity to P. agglomerans or P. ananatis and (3) isolates from diseased Eucalyptus, maize and onion, assigned to the genus on the basis of phenotypic tests. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the sequences of the four housekeeping genes. The "core" Pantoea species formed a cluster separate from the "Japanese" species which formed a tight cluster that included the genus Tatumella when the tree was based on concatenated sequences of the four genes. The MLSA data further suggested the existence of ten potential novel species, phylogenetically related to the currently recognized Pantoea species and the possible inclusion of Pectobacterium cypripedii in the genus Pantoea. When compared with DNA-DNA hybridization data, a good congruence was observed between both methods, with gyrB sequence data being the most consistent. In conclusion, MLSA of partial nucleotide sequences of the genes gyrB, rpoB, atpD and infB can be used for classification, identification and phylogenetic analyses of Pantoea strains. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {In common with other bacterial taxa, members of the genus Neisseria are classified using a range of phenotypic and biochemical approaches, which are not entirely satisfactory in assigning isolates to species groups. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using nucleotide sequences for bacterial typing and taxonomy, but to date, no broadly accepted alternative to conventional methods is available. Here, the taxonomic relationships of 55 representative members of the genus Neisseria have been analysed using whole-genome sequence data. As genetic material belonging to the accessory genome is widely shared among different taxa but not present in all isolates, this analysis indexed nucleotide sequence variation within sets of genes, specifically protein-coding genes that were present and directly comparable in all isolates. Variation in these genes identified seven species groups, which were robust to the choice of genes and phylogenetic clustering methods used. The groupings were largely, but not completely, congruent with current species designations, with some minor changes in nomenclature and the reassignment of a few isolates necessary. In particular, these data showed that isolates classified as Neisseria polysaccharea are polyphyletic and probably include more than one taxonomically distinct organism. The seven groups could be reliably and rapidly generated with sequence variation within the 53 ribosomal protein subunit (rps) genes, further demonstrating that ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST) is a practicable and powerful means of characterizing bacteria at all levels, from domain to strain.},

abstract = {GET{\_}HOMOLOGUES is an open-source software package that builds on popular orthology-calling approaches making highly customizable and detailed pangenome analyses of microorganisms accessible to nonbioinformaticians. It can cluster homologous gene families using the bidirectional best-hit, COGtriangles, or OrthoMCL clustering algorithms. Clustering stringency can be adjusted by scanning the domain composition of proteins using the HMMER3 package, by imposing desired pairwise alignment coverage cutoffs, or by selecting only syntenic genes. The resulting homologous gene families can be made even more robust by computing consensus clusters from those generated by any combination of the clustering algorithms and filtering criteria. Auxiliary scripts make the construction, interrogation, and graphical display of core genome and pangenome sets easy to perform. Exponential and binomial mixture models can be fitted to the data to estimate theoretical core genome and pangenome sizes, and high-quality graphics can be generated. Furthermore, pangenome trees can be easily computed and basic comparative genomics performed to identify lineage-specific genes or gene family expansions. The software is designed to take advantage of modern multiprocessor personal computers as well as computer clusters to parallelize time-consuming tasks. To demonstrate some of these capabilities, we survey a set of 50 Streptococcus genomes annotated in the Orthologous Matrix (OMA) browser as a benchmark case.

These three 'Japanese' species have been shown to be phylogenetically distant from other species of the genus Pantoea. It has been observed previously that, using multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), the 'Japanese' species consistently formed a distinct clade with an extended branch length, casting doubt on the inclusion of these species within the genus Pantoea. Furthermore, the 'Japanese' species are closely related to Tatumella ptyseos, strains of which originate from human clinical specimens. DNA-DNA hybridization and phenotypic tests confirmed the observed phylogenetic distance of P. citrea, P. punctata and P. terrea from the genus Pantoea and the affiliation of these species with Tatumella. In addition, strains causing pink disease of pineapple, identified previously as P. citrea, were shown to represent a separate species by using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, and MLSA and DNA-DNA hybridization data.

The patient underwent two arthrotomies and was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate intravenously for three weeks. The postoperative course was uneventful, and joint function returned to normal. A review of the literature between 1953 and 2002 revealed that bacterial growth after plant thorn injuries is reported infrequently. Yet when reported, Pantoea agglomearns is the most common organism found. Therefore, it must be considered and suspected in "aseptic" cases of arthritis, when there is a history of a plant thorn injury.

Four data sets were compiled, two of which consisted of previously published data. The data sets were designed in order to evaluate how 16S rDNA gene phylogenies are affected by the use of different plant pathogen accessions and varying numbers of animal pathogen and outgroup sequences. DNA data matrices were analyzed using maximum likelihood (ML) algorithms, and character support was determined by ML bootstrap and Bayesian analyses. As additional animal pathogen sequences were added to the phylogenetic analyses, taxon placement changed. Further, the phylogenies varied in their placement of the plant pathogen species, and only the genus Pantoea was monophyletic in all four trees. Finally, bootstrap and Bayesian support values were low for most of the nodes, and all nonterminal branches collapsed in strict consensus trees. Inspection of 16S rDNA nucleotide alignments revealed several highly variable blocks punctuated by regions of conserved sequence. These data suggest that 16S rDNA, while effective for both species-level and family-level phylogenetic reconstruction, may underperform for genus-level phylogenetic analyses in the Enterobacteriaceae.},

abstract = {The Erwiniaceae contain many species of agricultural and clinical importance. Although relationships among most of the genera in this family are relatively well resolved, the phylogenetic placement of several taxa remains ambiguous. In this study, we aimed to address these uncertainties by using a combination of phylogenetic and genomic approaches. Our multilocus sequence analysis and genome-based maximum-likelihood phylogenies revealed that the arsenate-reducing strain IMH and plant-associated strain ATCC 700886, both previously presumptively identified as members of Pantoea, represent novel species of Erwinia. Our data also showed that the taxonomy of Erwinia teleogrylli requires revision as it is clearly excluded from Erwinia and the other genera of the family. Most strikingly, however, five species of Pantoea formed a distinct clade within the Erwiniaceae, where it had a sister group relationship with the Pantoea + Tatumella clade. By making use of gene content comparisons, this new clade is further predicted to encode a range of characters that it shares with or distinguishes it from related genera. We thus propose recognition of this clade as a distinct genus and suggest the name Mixta in reference to the diverse habitats from which its species were obtained, including plants, humans and food products. Accordingly, a description for Mixta gen. nov. is provided to accommodate the four species Mixta calida comb. nov., M. gaviniae comb. nov., M. intestinalis comb. nov. and M. theicola comb. nov., with M. calida as the type species for the genus.},

Important factors contributing to the development of the disease were discovered in the last decades. Comparative genomics of the genera Erwinia and Pantoea is coming into focus with the recent availability of complete genome sequences. Insights from comparative genomics now position us to answer fundamental questions regarding the evolution of E. amylovora as a successful pathogen and the critical elements for biocontrol activity of Pantoea spp. This trove of new data promises to reveal novel determinants and to understand interactive pathways for virulence, host range and ecological fitness. The ultimate aim is now to apply genomics and identify the pathogen Achilles heels and antagonist mechanisms of action as targets for designing innovative control strategies for fire blight. {\textcopyright}2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {AbstractOrthologs and paralogs are two fundamentally different types of homologous genes that evolved, respectively, by vertical descent from a single ancestral gene and by duplication. Orthology and paralogy are key concepts of evolutionary genomics. A clear distinction between orthologs and paralogs is critical for the construction of a robust evolutionary classification of genes and reliable functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes. Genome comparisons show that orthologous relationships with genes from taxonomically distant species can be established for the majority of the genes from each sequenced genome. This review examines in depth the definitions and subtypes of orthologs and paralogs, outlines the principal methodological approaches employed for identification of orthology and paralogy, and considers evolutionary and functional implications of these concepts.},

abstract = {Five Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming, coccoid rod-shaped bacterial isolates were obtained from infant formula and an infant formula production environment and were investigated by use of a polyphasic taxonomic study. Biochemical tests and partial rpoB gene sequence analysis of the five isolates revealed that they formed two distinct groups in the family Enterobacteriaceae, closely related to several species of the genera Pantoea and Erwinia, which indicated a phylogenetic position within the genus Pantoea or the genus Erwinia. Multilocus sequence analysis of concatenated partial atpD, gyrB, infB and rpoB gene sequences of two of the isolates suggested that they represented two novel species of the genus Pantoea, phylogenetically related most closely to Pantoea septica. The five isolates had general characteristics consistent with those of the genus Pantoea, and DNA-DNA hybridizations between two representatives and the type strains of their phylogenetically closest relatives based on comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the isolates represented two novel genospecies. These two genospecies could be differentiated from each other based on fermentation of galacturonate, sorbitol and potassium 5-ketogluconate. They could be differentiated from phylogenetically related Pantoea species based on their ability to ferment lactose and to utilize b-gentiobiose and raffinose, their inability to ferment or utilize D-arabitol, and their inability to produce indole. On the basis of the results obtained, the five isolates are considered to represent two novel species of the genus Pantoea, for which the names Pantoea gaviniae sp. nov.

For molecular classification, the 16S rRNA cistron and the conserved genes gpd and recA of these bacteria were investigated.

Multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) placed the two strains in the genus Erwinia and supported their classification as a novel species. The strains showed general phenotypic characteristics typical of this genus and results of DNA–DNA hybridizations confirmed that they represent a single novel species. Both strains showed a DNA G+C content, as determined by HPLC, of 54.5 mol{\%} and could be discriminated from phylogenetically related species of the genus Erwinia by their ability to utilize potassium gluconate, potassium 2-ketogluconate, maltose, melibiose and raffinose.Whole-genome sequencing of strain EM595T revealed the presence of a chromosomal carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster similar to those found in species of the genera Cronobacter and Pantoea that explains the pigmentation of the strain, which is atypical for the genus Erwinia. Additional strains belonging to the same species were recovered from different plant hosts in three different continents, revealing the cosmopolitan nature of this epiphyte.

These strains exhibited more than 99.5{\%} sequence identity and within experimental uncertainty could be regarded as identical. Their close taxonomic relationship was further documented by phenotypic similarities. In contrast, previously published DNA-DNA hybridization results have convincingly established that these strains do not belong to the same species if current standards are used. These results emphasize the important point that effective identity of 16S rRNA sequences is not necessarily a sufficient criterion to guarantee species identity. Thus, although 16S rRNA sequences can be used routinely to distinguish and establish relationships between genera and well-resolved species, very recently diverged species may not be recognizable.},

abstract = {DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) has been used for nearly 50 years as the gold standard for prokaryotic species circumscriptions at the genomic level. It has been the only taxonomic method that offered a numerical and relatively stable species boundary, and its use has had a paramount influence on how the current classification has been constructed. However, now, in the era of genomics, DDH appears to be an outdated method for classification that needs to be substituted. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) between two genomes seems the most promising method since it mirrors DDH closely. Here we examine the work package JSpecies as a user-friendly, biologist-oriented interface to calculate ANI and the correlation of the tetranucleotide signatures between pairwise genomic comparisons. The results agreed with the use of ANI to substitute DDH, with a narrowed boundary that could be set at approximately 95-96{\%}. In addition, the JSpecies package implemented the tetranucleotide signature correlation index, an alignment-free parameter that generally correlates with ANI and that can be of help in deciding when a given pair of organisms should be classified in the same species. Moreover, for taxonomic purposes, the analyses can be produced by simply randomly sequencing at least 20{\%} of the genome of the query strains rather than obtaining their full sequence.},

abstract = {To obtain a higher resolution of the phylogenetic relationships of species within a genus or genera within a family, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) is currently a widely used method. In MLSA studies, partial sequences of genes coding for proteins with conserved functions ('housekeeping genes') are used to generate phylogenetic trees and subsequently deduce phylogenies. However, MLSA is not only suggested as a phylogenetic tool to support and clarify the resolution of bacterial species with a higher resolution, as in 16S rRNA gene-based studies, but has also been discussed as a replacement for DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) in species delineation. Nevertheless, despite the fact that MLSA has become an accepted and widely used method in prokaryotic taxonomy, no common generally accepted recommendations have been devised to date for either the whole area of microbial taxonomy or for taxa-specific applications of individual MLSA schemes. The different ways MLSA is performed can vary greatly for the selection of genes, their number, and the calculation method used when comparing the sequences obtained. Here, we provide an overview of the historical development of MLSA and critically review its current application in prokaryotic taxonomy by highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the method's numerous variations. This provides a perspective for its future use in forthcoming genome-based genotypic taxonomic analyses.},

Previous characterization of this novel pathogen by phenotypic and genotypic methods suggested that it should belong to the genus Erwinia but might not correspond to either Erwinia amylovora or Erwinia pyrifoliae . Here, phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene, gyrB, and rpoD gene sequences indicated that it could not be assigned to any recognized species of the genus Erwinia . DNA–DNA hybridization confirmed that the bacterial strains represented a novel species. The DNA G+C contents, the fatty acid profile and phenotypic characteristics resembled those previously reported for members of the genus Erwinia . On the basis of these and previous results, the pathogen represents a novel species of the genus Erwinia , for which the name Erwinia uzenensis sp. nov.

abstract = {The ranks higher than the species in the prokaryotic taxonomy are primarily designated based on phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences, but no definite standards exist for the absolute relatedness (measured by 16S rRNA or other means) between the ranks. Accordingly, it remains unknown how comparable the ranks are between different organisms. To gain insights into this question, we studied the relationship between shared gene content and genetic relatedness for 175 fully sequenced strains, using as a robust measure of relatedness the average amino acid identity (AAI) of the shared genes. Our results reveal that adjacent ranks (e.g., phylum versus class) frequently show extensive overlap in terms of genetic and gene content relatedness of the grouped organisms, and hence, the current system is of limited predictive power in this respect. The overlap between nonadjacent ranks (e.g., phylum versus family) is generally limited and attributable to clear inconsistencies of the taxonomy. In addition to providing means for standardizing taxonomy, our AAI-based approach provides a means to evaluate the robustness of alternative genetic markers for phylogenetic purposes. For instance, the 23S rRNA gene was found to be as good a marker as the 16S rRNA gene, while several of the widely distributed protein-coding genes, such as the RNA polymerase and gyrase subunits, show a strong phylogenetic signal, albeit less strong than the rRNA genes (0.78 {\textgreater} R2 {\textgreater} 0.69 for the protein-coding genes versus R2 = 0.84 for the rRNA genes). The AAI approach outlined here could contribute significantly to a genome-based taxonomy for all microbial organisms.},

abstract = {There is an increasing interest in studying interspecies bacterial interactions in diseases of animals and plants as it is believed that the great majority of bacteria found in nature live in complex communities. Plant pathologists have thus far mainly focused on studies involving single species or on their interactions with antagonistic competitors. A bacterial disease used as model to study multispecies interactions is the olive knot disease, caused by Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi (Psv). Knots caused by Psv in branches and other aerial parts of the olive trees are an ideal niche not only for the pathogen but also for many other plant-associated bacterial species, mainly belonging to the genera Pantoea, Pectobacterium, Erwinia, and Curtobacterium. The non-pathogenic bacterial species Erwinia toletana, Pantoea agglomerans, and Erwinia oleae, which are frequently isolated inside the olive knots, cooperate with Psv in modulating the disease severity. Co-inoculations of these species with Psv result in bigger knots and better bacterial colonization when compared to single inoculations. Moreover, harmless bacteria co-localize with the pathogen inside the knots, indicating the formation of stable bacterial consortia that may facilitate the exchange of quorum sensing signals and metabolites. Here we discuss the possible role of bacterial communities in the establishment and development of olive knot disease, which we believe could be taking place in many other bacterial plant diseases.},

abstract = {Comparison of the sequences of conserved genes, most commonly those encoding 16S rRNA, is used for bacterial genotypic identification. Among some taxa, such as the Enterobacteriaceae, variation within this gene does not allow confident species identification. We investigated the usefulness of RNA polymerase beta-subunit encoding gene (rpoB?) sequences as an alternative tool for universal bacterial genotypic identification. We generated a database of partial rpoB for 14 Enterobacteriaceae species and then assessed the intra- and interspecies divergence between the rpoB and the 16S rRNA genes by pairwise comparisons. We found that levels of divergence between the rpoB sequences of different strains were markedly higher than those between their 16S rRNA genes. This higher discriminatory power was further confirmed by assigning 20 blindly selected clinical isolates to the correct enteric species on the basis of rpoB sequence comparison. Comparison of rpoB sequences from Enterobacteriaceae was also used as the basis for their phylogenetic analysis and demonstrated the genus Klebsiella to be polyphyletic. The trees obtained with rpoB were more compatible with the currently accepted classification of Enterobacteriaceae than those obtained with 16S rRNA. These data indicate that rpoB is a powerful identification tool, which may be useful for universal bacterial identification.},

@article{Staley2006,
abstract = {The number of species of Bacteria and Archaea (ca 5000) is surprisingly small considering their early evolution, genetic diversity and residence in all ecosystems. The bacterial species definition accounts in part for the small number of named species. The primary procedures required to identify new species of Bacteria and Archaea are DNA-DNA hybridization and phenotypic characterization. Recently, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis have been applied to bacterial taxonomy. Although 16S phylogeny is arguably excellent for classification of Bacteria and Archaea from the Domain level down to the family or genus, it lacks resolution below that level. Newer approaches, including multilocus sequence analysis, and genome sequence and microarray analyses, promise to provide necessary information to better understand bacterial speciation. Indeed, recent data using these approaches, while meagre, support the view that speciation processes may occur at the subspecies level within ecological niches (ecovars) and owing to biogeography (geovars). A major dilemma for bacterial taxonomists is how to incorporate this new information into the present hierarchical system for classification of Bacteria and Archaea without causing undesirable confusion and contention. This author proposes the genomic-phylogenetic species concept (GPSC) for the taxonomy of prokaryotes. The aim is twofold. First, the GPSC would provide a conceptual and testable framework for bacterial taxonomy. Second, the GPSC would replace the burdensome requirement for DNA hybridization presently needed to describe new species. Furthermore, the GPSC is consistent with the present treatment at higher taxonomic levels.},

Phenotypic analyses clustered the novel isolates into one phenon, distinct from other species of the genus Erwinia, showing that the novel isolates constituted a homogeneous phenotypic group. Rep-PCR profiles, PCR products obtained with different pairs of primers and plasmid contents determined by restriction analysis showed differences between the novel strains and reference strains of E. amylovora and E. pyrifoliae. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA, gpd and recA gene sequences showed that the eight novel strains could not be assigned to any recognized species. On the basis of DNA–DNA hybridization studies, the novel isolates constituted a single group with relatedness values of 87–100 {\%} to the designated type strain of the group, CFBP 5888T. Depending on the method used, strain CFBP 5888T showed DNA–DNA relatedness values of between 22.7 and 50 {\%} to strains of the closely related species E. amylovora and E. tasmaniensis. The DNA G+C contents of two of the novel strains, CFBP 5888T and CFBP 5883, were 51.1 and 50.5 mol{\%}, respectively.

The beetles were collected from the bark of Norway spruce (Picea abies) in Lithuania. Bark beetles feed on conifers, which produce myrcene among many other defensive compounds. It has been suggested that the micro-organisms present within the beetles' guts could be involved in their resistance towards this plant defensive compound. The most resistant bacterial strains were isolated and characterized by phenotypic assays as well as fatty acid analysis, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multilocus sequence analyses (MLSA) based on the rpoB, atpD and infB genes and DNA–DNA hybridization. Biochemical characterization indicated that the bacteria belonged to the family Enterobacteriaceae . Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene sequences and MLSA of the novel strains revealed that they belonged to the genus Erwinia , but represented a novel species.

Compared to other biocontrol agents, relatively little is currently known regarding Pantoea genetics. Better understanding of antagonist mechanisms of action and ecological fitness is critical to improving efficacy. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Genome analysis indicated two major factors Contribute to biocontrol activity: competition for limiting substrates and antibacterial metabolite production. Pathways for utilization of a broad diversity of sugars and acquisition of iron were identified. Metabolism of sorbitol by P. vagans C9-1 may be a major metabolic feature in biocontrol of fire blight. Biosynthetic genes for the antibacterial peptide pantocin A were found on a chromosomal 28-kb genomic island, and for dapdiamide E on the plasmid pPag2. There was no evidence of potential virulence factors that could enable an animal or phytopathogenic lifestyle and no indication of any genetic-based biosafety risk in the antagonist. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying key determinants contributing to disease suppression allows the development of procedures to follow their expression in planta and the genome sequence contributes to rationale risk assessment regarding the use of the biocontrol strain in agricultural systems.},

The analyses revealed that DNA HG II, IV and V and Pectobacterium cypripedii form five separate branches within the genus Pantoea (strains from HG V were split into two branches). DNA-DNA hybridization data further confirmed that DNA HG II, IV and V constitute four separate species. Pectobacterium cypripedii was shown to be a close phylogenetic relative of Pantoea dispersa and DNA HG IV by both 16S rRNA gene sequence and MLSA analyses. Biochemical analyses performed on strains from DNA HG II, IV and V and Pectobacterium cypripedii confirmed their taxonomic position within the genus Pantoea and revealed phenotypic characteristics that allow the differentiation of these species from each other and from their closest phylogenetic neighbours. It is proposed to emend the description of the genus Pantoea and to describe Pantoea septica sp. nov. for DNA HG II (type strain LMG 5345T =BD 874T =CDC 3123-70T), Pantoea eucrina sp. nov. for DNA HG IV (type strain LMG 2781T =BD 872T =CDC 1741-71 T =LMG 5346T), Pantoea brenneri sp. nov. for strains of DNA HG V excluding LMG 24534 (type strain LMG 5343T =BD 873 T =CDC 3482-71T) and Pantoea conspicua sp. nov. for the remaining strain of DNA HG V (type strain LMG 24534T =BD 805 T =CDC 3527-71T) and to transfer Pectobacterium cypripedii to the genus as Pantoea cypripedii comb. nov.

abstract = {Summary
The almost complete 16S rDNA sequences of twenty nine plant-associated strains, representing species of the genera Erwinia, Pantoea and Enterobacter were determined and compared with those of other members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The species of the genus Erwinia may be divided into three phylogenetic groups. Cluster I represents the true erwinias and comprises E. amylovora, E. mallotivora, E. persicinus, E. psidii, E. rhapontici and E. tracheiphila. We propose to unite the species of cluster II, E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, E. carotovora subsp. odorifera, E. carotovora subsp. wasabiae, E. cacticida, E. chrysanthemi and E. cypripedii in the genus Pectobacterium respectively as P. carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum comb, nov., P. carotovorum subsp. betavasculorum comb, nov., P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum comb, nov., P. carotovorum subsp. odoriferum comb, nov., P. carotovorum subsp. wasabiae comb, nov., P. cacticidum comb, nov., P. chrysanthemi and P. cypripedii. The species E. alni, E. nigrifluens, E. paradisiaca, E. quercina, E. rubrifaciens and E. salicis, comprising cluster III, are being classified into a new genus Brenneria gen. nov. respectively as B. alni comb. nov., B. nigrifluens comb. nov., B. paradisiaca comb. nov., B. quercina comb. nov., B. rubrifaciens comb. nov. and B. salicis comb. nov. The species of the genus Pantoea, included in this study, form a monophyletic unit (cluster IV), closely related with Erwinia, whereas the three phytopathogenic species of the genus Enterobacter are scattered among the genera Citrobacter and Klebsiella.},

abstract = {The genera Erwinia and Pantoea contain species that are devastating plant pathogens, non-pathogen epiphytes, and opportunistic human pathogens. However, some controversies persist in the taxonomic classification of these two closely related genera. The phylogenomic analysis of these two genera was investigated via a comprehensive analysis of 25 Erwinia genomes and 23 Pantoea genomes. Single-copy orthologs could be extracted from the Erwinia/Pantoea core-genome to reconstruct the Erwinia/Pantoea phylogeny. This tree has strong bootstrap support for almost all branches. We also estimated the in silico DNA–DNA hybridization (isDDH) and the average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between each genome; strains from the same species showed ANI values ≥96 {\%} and isDDH values {\textgreater}70 {\%}. These data confirm that whole genome sequence data provides a powerful tool to resolve the complex taxonomic questions of Erwinia/Pantoea, e.g. Pantoea agglomerans 299R was not clustered into a single group with other P. agglomerans strains, and the ANI values and isDDH values between them were {\textless}91 {\%} and around 43.8 {\%}, respectively. These data indicate P. agglomerans 299R should not be classified into the P. agglomerans species. In addition, another strain (Pantoea sp. At{\_}9b) was identified that may represent a novel Pantoea species. We also evaluated the performance of six commonly used housekeeping genes (atpD, carA, gyrB, infB, recA, and rpoB) in phylogenetic inference. A single gene was not enough to obtain a reliable species tree, and it was necessary to use the multilocus sequence analysis of the six marker genes to recover the Erwinia/Pantoea phylogeny.},

Genome sequencing has greatly facilitated the evaluation of the current taxonomic system and the development of simpler, more portable and accurate, sequence-based alternatives to substitute for the traditional cumbersome methods. Studies based on the former genome-enabled methods reveal that existing taxonomic designations, including the species level, correspond frequently to a continuum of genetic diversity as opposed to natural groupings (e.g. biological species). Improving such artificial and often ambiguous taxonomic designations, however, will require larger genomic datasets and more carefully designed sampling of natural populations.

abstract = {Understanding of the phylogeny and interrelationships of the genera within the order ‘Enterobacteriales' has proven difficult using the 16S rRNA gene and other single-gene or limited multi-gene approaches. In this work, we have completed comprehensive comparative genomic analyses of the members of the order ‘Enterobacteriales' which includes phylogenetic reconstructions based on 1548 core proteins, 53 ribosomal proteins and four multilocus sequence analysis proteins, as well as examining the overall genome similarity amongst the members of this order. The results of these analyses all support the existence of seven distinct monophyletic groups of genera within the order ‘Enterobacteriales'. In parallel, our analyses of protein sequences from the ‘Enterobacteriales' genomes have identified numerous molecular characteristics in the forms of conserved signature insertions/deletions, which are specifically shared by the members of the identified clades and independently support their monophyly and distinctness. Many of these groupings, either in part or in whole, have been recognized in previous evolutionary studies, but have not been consistently resolved as monophyletic entities in 16S rRNA gene trees. The work presented here represents the first comprehensive, genomescale taxonomic analysis of the entirety of the order ‘Enterobacteriales'. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses and the numerous identified conserved molecular characteristics, which clearly distinguish members of the order ‘Enterobacteriales' and the seven reported clades within this order, a proposal is made here for the order Enterobacterales ord. nov. which consists of seven families: Enterobacteriaceae, Erwiniaceae fam. nov., Pectobacteriaceae fam. nov., Yersiniaceae fam. nov., Hafniaceae fam. nov., Morganellaceae fam. nov., and Budviciaceae fam. nov.},

Sixty-one publically available E. coli and Shigella spp. sequenced genomes are compared, using basic methods to produce phylogenetic and proteomics trees, and to identify the pan- and core genomes of this set of sequenced strains. A hierarchical clustering of variable genes allowed clear separation of the strains into clusters, including known pathotypes; clinically relevant serotypes can also be resolved in this way. In contrast, when in silico MLST was performed, many of the various strains appear jumbled and less well resolved. The predicted pan-genome comprises 15,741 gene families, and only 993 (6{\%}) of the families are represented in every genome, comprising the core genome. The variable or ‘accessory' genes thus make up more than 90{\%} of the pan-genome and about 80{\%} of a typical genome; some of these variable genes tend to be co-localized on genomic islands. The diversity within the species E. coli, and the overlap in gene content between this and related species, suggests a continuum rather than sharp species borders in this group of Enterobacteriaceae.},

Since the discovery of the molecular structure of genes, it has been clear that the substrate over which the adaptive landscape should be properly defined is the space of genetic sequences [3]. Nevertheless, apart from a few landmark papers [4, 5], adaptation has not been in the focus of the theory of molecular evolution, which instead has concentrated on the effects of stochastic drift in a neutral (flat) fitness landscape [6]. This situation is presently changing [7, 8]. Long-term evolution experiments on microbial populations [9] are beginning to produce a wealth of data, on the phenotypic as well as on the genotypic level, which make it meaningful to ask precise questions about the timing and size of adaptive events, and what they can tell us about the structure of the underlying adaptive landscape.},

abstract = {Investigation of the evolutionary relationships between related bacterial species and genera with a variety of lifestyles have gained popularity in recent years. For analysing the evolution of specific traits, however, a robust phylogeny is essential. In this study we examined the evolutionary relationships among the closely related genera Erwinia, Tatumella and Pantoea, and also attempted to resolve the species relationships within Pantoea. To accomplish this, we used the whole genome sequence data for 35 different strains belonging to these three genera, as well as nine outgroup taxa. Multigene datasets consisting of the 1039 genes shared by these 44 strains were then generated and subjected to maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses, after which the results were compared to those using conventional multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) and ribosomal MLSA (rMLSA) approaches. The robustness of the respective phylogenies was then explored by considering the factors typically responsible for destabilizing phylogenetic trees. We found that the nucleotide datasets employed in the MLSA, rMLSA and 1039-gene datasets contained significant levels of homoplasy, substitution saturation and differential codon usage, all of which likely gave rise to the observed lineage specific rate heterogeneity. The effects of these factors were much less pronounced in the amino acid dataset for the 1039 genes, which allowed reconstruction of a fully supported and resolved phylogeny. The robustness of this amino acid tree was also supported by different subsets of the 1039 genes. In contrast to the smaller datasets (MLSA and rMLSA), the 1039 amino acid tree was also not as sensitive to long-branch attraction. The robust and well-supported evolutionary hypothesis for the three genera, which confidently resolved their various inter- and intrageneric relationships, represents a valuable resource for future studies. It will form the basis for studies aiming to understand the forces driving the divergence and maintenance of lineages, species and biological traits in this important group of bacteria.},

abstract = {No single genealogical reconstruction or typing method currently encompasses all levels of bacterial diversity, from domain to strain. We propose ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST), an approach which indexes variation of the 53 genes encoding the bacterial ribosome protein subunits (rps genes), as a means of integrating microbial genealogy and typing. As with multilocus sequence typing (MLST), rMLST employs curated reference sequences to identify gene variants efficiently and rapidly. The rps loci are ideal targets for a universal characterization scheme as they are: (i) present in all bacteria; (ii) distributed around the chromosome; and (iii) encode proteins which are under stabilizing selection for functional conservation. Collectively, the rps loci exhibit variation that resolves bacteria into groups at all taxonomic and most typing levels, providing significantly more resolution than 16S small subunit rRNA gene phylogenies. A web-accessible expandable database, comprising whole-genome data from more than 1900 bacterial isolates, including 28 draft genomes assembled de novo from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) sequence read archive, has been assembled. The rps gene variation catalogued in this database permits rapid and computationally non-intensive identification of the phylogenetic position of any bacterial sequence at the domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species and strain levels. The groupings generated with rMLST data are consistent with current nomenclature schemes and independent of the clustering algorithm used. This approach is applicable to the other domains of life, potentially providing a rational and universal approach to the classification of life that is based on one of its fundamental features, the translation mechanism.},
