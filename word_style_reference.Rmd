# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Header_3
This is for Header3

Let's hope that this all works. Pretty Please!!

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library("dplyr")
strain <- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow = 10, ncol = 0))
strain <- mutate(strain, 
                 Species = c("Mixta calida", "Mixta gaviniae", "Pantoea agglomerans", "Pantoea septica", "Erwinia amylovora", 
                             "Erwinia tasmaniensis", "Tatumella ptyseos", "Tatumella saanichensis", "Citrobacter freundii", 
                             "Enterobacter cloacae subsp cloacae"),
                 Strain = c("DSM_22759", "DSM_22758", "NBRC_102470", "LMG_5345", "CFBP_1232", "ET1/99", "NCTC_11468",

                           "complete genome", "contigs", "complete genome", "complete genome")

kable(strain, caption = "Table __. Species' names, strains, and assembly levels that are involved in the study.")

# Header_Page_Break

Just need this for a page break.

What I still need:
- Page numbers
- Table of contents
- List of Figures
- List of Abbreviations

# Table of Contents

```{=openxml}
<w:p><w:r><w:br w:type="page"/></w:r></w:p>
```
# References
